I can definitely help you get that sorted out.\n\nTo start, could you please tell me your full name?\n\nUser: jaya  roy\n\nAssistant: Thank you, Jaya.\n\nNext, could you please provide your 10-digit mobile number so we can reach you regarding the service?\n\nUser: 7777777777\n\nAssistant: Thank you, Jaya. I've noted down your phone number as 7777777777.\n\nCould you please share your email address with me?

I have your email as hghghg@ghgh.com.\n\nNow, could you please tell me your exact location or area in Kolkata? This helps us assign the nearest technician to you.\n\nUser: 65 tryttr bnf bdhgfh kol 8898768\n\nAssistant: Thank you, Jaya. I understand you're located in Kolkata. To ensure our technician can find you easily, could you please provide a more specific area or landmark within Kolkata? For example, \"Salt Lake Sector 1\" or \"Near Gariahat Market\".\n\nThe address you provided seems to include a pin code that doesn't match Kolkata. Could you please reconfirm your exact area in Kolkata?\n\nUser: 700077\n\nAssistant: Thank you for providing the pin code, Jaya. 700077 is helpful!\n\nJust to confirm, could you please tell me the specific area or locality in Kolkata that corresponds to this pin code?

So, your location is Dumdum, Kolkata.\n\nNow that I have your contact details and location, let's talk about your AC.

This helps us understand if any specific parts might be needed.\n\nUser: lg\n\nAssistant: Thanks, Jaya. Your LG AC is not cooling.\n\nBased on the issue you described, it sounds like your AC might need a **Check Up** to diagnose the problem, which costs \u20b9299. If it turns out to be a gas issue, a **Gas Refilling** service is available for \u20b9799. Other repairs would be from \u20b9499 depending on the diagnosis.\n\nWould you like to proceed with a **Check Up** service for \u20b9299 to have our technician diagnose why your LG AC isn't cooling?\n\nUser: ceck up\n\nAssistant: Great, Jaya! We'll schedule a **Check Up** for your LG AC. The service charge for the check-up is \u20b9299. Our technician will visit, diagnose the problem, and then inform you about any further repair costs if needed.\n\nNow, to schedule the appointment, what would be your preferred date for the service?\n\nUser: oky\n\nAssistant: Thank you, Jaya!\n\nWhat specific date would you prefer for the AC check-up? For example, \"tomorrow,\" \"this Saturday,\" or \"August 25th.\"\n\nUser: tomorrow\n\nAssistant: Got it, Jaya. So, you'd like the AC check-up scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nTo help us find the best slot for you, what would be your preferred time slot?

We can absolutely add your AC service to the booking.\n\nTo help me recommend the right service and price, could you please tell me:\n\n1.  What type of AC do you have (e.g., **Window AC** or **Split AC**)?\n2.  What kind of service are you looking for, or what issue are you facing with your AC?\n\nUser: need  a  cleaning\n\nAssistant: Okay, Rajiv! A cleaning service for your AC is a great idea.\n\nTo give you the correct pricing, could you please tell me if it's a **Window AC** or a **Split AC** that you'd like to have cleaned?\n\nUser: splite  ac\n\nAssistant: Thank you for clarifying, Rajiv.
